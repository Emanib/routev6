# Getting Started with Create React App

!##Task:
- Assume you have three roles in your app, the  roles ( Admin, Employer, Talent ), 
- Admin has three pages
- Employer has four pages one of these pages shared with the admin, so the admin could reach just one of these pages
- Talent has three pages these pages are not accessible for admin or employer
- There is a home page anyone can access, and it contains the links to navigate to the pages.


Make a React app with these pages, every page just contains a title, the title of the page will be the user roles that can access this page.
